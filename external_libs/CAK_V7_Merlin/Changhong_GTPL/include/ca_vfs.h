/**
 *  @brief
 *    This function changes the seek pointer of the file. The next read or 
 *    write operation will occur at the requested position.  If the file was 
 *    opened in writing mode \c VFS_FILE_OPEN_APPEND, the next write will still 
 *    be done at the end of the file.
 *
 *    Giving an absolute offset of 0 will cause the next read or write 
 *    operation to act on the very beginning of the file.
 *
 *    Given an absolute offset out of the file limits, the \c vfsSeekInFile() 
 *    function returns \c VFS_ERROR_END_OF_FILE. The seek pointer is left 
 *    untouched.
 *
 *  @param[in]  xFileHandle
 *    Handle to the file of which the seek pointer shall 
 *    be changed to.
 *  @param[in]  xOffset
 *    New absolute or relative offset of the file.
 *  @param[in]  xSeekMode
 *    Defines is the offset is absolute or relative to the 
 *    current position. 
 *
 *  @retval VFS_NO_ERROR
 *            Success to seek file pointer.
 *  @retval VFS_ERROR_BAD_HANDLE

 *            Some parameters have an unsupported value.
 *  @retval VFS_ERROR_END_OF_FILE

 *            file limits.
 *  @retval VFS_ERROR
 *            Other error.
