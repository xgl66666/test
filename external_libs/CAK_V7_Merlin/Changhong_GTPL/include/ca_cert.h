/** @page p_conventions Used conventions
 *  <h2>Bit indexing</h2>
 *  Bits inside one byte B are numbered from 7 (most significant bit) down to 0
 *  (least significant bit).
 *  @image html bit_index.png
 *  @image rtf bit_index.png
 *
 *  Accordingly, bits inside a N-bit string are numbered from N-1 (most 
 *  significant bit) down to 0 (least significant bit). Where explicit bit 
 *  indexing is needed, the bit range is indicated between square brackets, with 
 *  MS index first, then a colon, and the LS index last. For instance the three 
 *  least significant bits of byte B are written as B[2:0]. 
 *
 *  <hr><h2>Byte indexing</h2>
 *  Bits inside one byte B are numbered from 7 (most significant bit) down to 0
 *  (least significant bit).
 *  @image html byte_index.png
 *  @image rtf byte_index.png
 *  
 *  Bytes inside a N-byte string VAL are numbered from 0 (most significant byte) 
 *  to N-1 (least significant byte). This corresponds to a big-endian notation 
 *  ordering.
 *  
 *  Where explicit byte indexing is needed, the byte range is indicated between 
 *  square brackets, with most significant index first, then a colon, and the 
 *  least significant index last. For instance the four most significant bytes 
 *  of VAL are written as VAL[0:3].
 *  
 *  \note
 *  A N-byte string can also be viewed as a 8*N-bit string. In this case, bit 
 *  indexing is used (e.g. the least significant byte will contain bits from 7 
 *  down to 0, while the most significant byte will contain bits from 8*(N-1)+7 
 *  down to 8*(N-1). In general, if we need to convert from a N-byte string to a 
 *  8*N-bit string, then byte at index p will contain bits at indexes 
 *  8*(N-1-p)+7 down to 8*(N-1-p). When not clear from the context, explicit 
 *  disambiguation is needed to distinguish between byte-indexing and bit 
 *  indexing of a value.

/** @page p_sw_stack Software stack context
 *  
 *  <b>Two implementations of the CERT API are required</b>: one in a bare 
 *  environment, before the operating system is available and another one based 
 *  on the operating system. The following sections highlight the CERT driver 
 *  within this two contexts.
 *  
 *  The SoC vendor is in charge of providing a reference implementation of the 
 *  CERT driver for these two cases, although the final implementation remains 
 *  under the responsibility of the STB manufacturer.
 *
 *  <hr>@section s_sw_stack_os OS-based software stack context
 *  @image html cert_software_stack_os.png
 *  @image rtf cert_software_stack_os.png
 *
 *  In this context the CERT API is used directly by CA applications (CAK, 
 *  DVL,...) to lock/unlock the CERT block resource and send commands to it.
 *  Keys processed by the CERT block are then handled through the SEC API.
 *
 *  <hr>@section s_sw_stack_bare Bare software stack context
 *  @image html cert_software_stack_bare.png
 *  @image rtf cert_software_stack_bare.png
 *
 *  In this context, the CERT API is used directly by Nagra Security Services to 
 *  send commands to the CERT block resource. Keys processed by the CERT block 
 *  are then handled through the BSD API.
 *
 *  The bare CERT driver does not need to cope with thread safety and mutual 
 *  exclusion. However, a "dummy" implementation of TCertLock() and 
 *  TCertUnlock() must be provided in order to return the handle parameter 
 *  required by TCertExchange().
 */

/** @page p_fct_table Function table
 *
 *  Functions of the CERT API are exposed to applications through a table of
 *  callback functions retrieved through a call to certGetFunctionTable().
 *
 *  The table also contains the version number of the implemented CERT API. It 
 *  is strongly recommended to use the macro #CERTAPI_VERSION_INT to assign the 
 *  correct version number in the function table.
 *
 *  All functions that are not deprecated have to be implemented. However, if a temporary partial
 *  implementation of the CERT API is provided, address of callbacks not
 *  implemented, or deprecated, has to be set to \c NULL.
 */

/** @page p_cert_lock Locking the CERT resource
 *
 *  In an OS-based environment the CERT block may be used by different independent 
 *  CA applications with their own threads and processes. Before sending 
 *  commands to the CERT block, a CA application must lock the resource for 
 *  exclusive use in order to guaranty consistencies of commands processed. The 
 *  resource is locked by calling TCertLock(). If this function is called while 
 *  the CERT resource is already locked by another application, it blocks until 
 *  the resource is freed.
 *
 *  In other words, the CERT driver is in charge of the mutual exclusion between 
 *  CA applications with regards to the CERT resource. It implies the 
 *  implementation of TCertLock() to be thread safe and reentrant. This 
 *  constraint does not apply to all other functions of the CERT API, because 
 *  they are already protected by the lock and are not allowed to be called 
 *  outside of a lock section.
 *
 *  Depending on the operating system architecture, inter-process communication
 *  (IPC) methods might be required to achieve the mutual exclusion.
 *  
 *  The CERT resource has to be released as soon as possible in order to avoid 
 *  blocking another application too long. CA application architecture has to 
 *  take this point into account.
 *  
 *  The TCertLock() function returns a handle that is passed back to 
 *  TCertExchange() and TCertUnlock() functions. This ensures TCertExchange() is 
 *  called only if TCertLock() has been called previously.
 *  
 *  The bare implementation of the CERT API does not need to cope with thread
 *  safety and mutual exclusion. However, a "dummy" implementation of TCertLock()
 *  and TCertUnlock() must be provided in order to return the handle parameter 
 *  required by TCertExchange().
 */

/** @page p_cert_cmd CERT command handling
 *
 *  @section s_cmd_principle Principle of operations
 *
 *  A CERT command is a single request to the CERT hardware block. The CERT API 
 *  TCertExchange() function sends a series of one or more commands to the CERT 
 *  block. The CERT driver is responsible for handling each command by writing 
 *  and reading the CERT block Common Interface registers.
 *  
 *  Refer to [NSR] for the interface specification of the CERT block hardware as 
 *  well as requirements associated to the integration of this block.
 *  
 *  The mapping between the command structure TCertCommand provided to 
 *  TCertExchange() and the CERT block Common Interface registers is defined as 
 *  follows:
 *  @image html cert_registers.png
 *  @image rtf cert_registers.png
 *  
 *  For each command provided to a TCertExchange() call, the CERT driver has to 
 *  apply the following operations:
 *  
 *  -# Write the 32-byte input data into the 8 CERT DATA_IN_X registers, 
 *     starting from DATA_IN_0 to DATA_IN_7 as described in the figure above.
 *  \n
 *  -# Write the 4-byte opcodes into the COMMAND register. As the least 
 *     significant bit of opcodes is set to 1, the CERT block starts the 
 *     processing right after the COMMAND register is written.
 *  \n
 *  -# Wait for the command processing completion either by polling the least 
 *     significant bit of the COMMAND register (this bit is cleared when the 
 *     command is over) or wait for an interrupt to be triggered on the 
 *     interrupt line out. When the interrupt is set, it must be cleared by 
 *     writing the INTERRUPT register.
 *  \n
 *  -# Read the STATUS_AKL register and write it in the status field
 *  \n
 *  -# Read the 8 CERT DATA_OUT_X registers and write them into the output data 
 *     structure, starting from DATA_OUT_0 to DATA_OUT_7 as described in figure 
 *     above.
 *  \n
 *  -# If the least significant bit of STATUS_AKL is set to 1, it means the 
 *     command failed. In such a case, the CERT driver must stop handling 
 *     remaining commands and must return to the caller. Retries are managed by 
 *     the CA software, not by the driver.
 *  \n
 *  -# If the command is successful, process the next command by repeating all 
 *     steps above.

/** @page p_use_cases Use cases
 *
 *  @section s_ucase_descrambling Program descrambling
 *  Figure below depicts the scenario to descramble a program with control words 
 *  protected by the CERT block.
 *  @image html cert_ucase_descrambling.png
 *  @image rtf cert_ucase_descrambling.png
 *
 *  (1)	The application starts a descrambling session for a given program. The 
 *      application provides the related transport session ID (TSID) and the 
 *      list of elementary stream to be descrambled (PIDs). 
 *
 *  (2)	The CAK opens a SEC API stream decryption session to descramble the 
 *      elementary streams referenced by the transport session ID.
 *  
 *  (3)	The CAK provides program metadata if any (e.g. copy control)
 *  
 *  (4)	The CERT block is reserved for exclusive use by the CAK
 *  
 *  (5)	The CAK makes a first CERT exchange to process the even control word. 
 *      The driver is then in charge of handling each command by writing/reading 
 *      CERT registers. At the end of this sequence, the even control word is 
 *      output on the CERT key interface bus.
 *  
 *  (6) The CAK calls the SEC API secUseCertKey() function in order to gets the 
 *      control word pending on the CERT block, copies it into the adequate slot 
 *      of the descrambler key table and acknowledges the CERT block.
 *  
 *  (7)	The odd control word is handled exactly the same way
 *  
 *  (8)	Finally, the CERT resource is released

/**
 *  @ingroup commandHandling
 *
 *  @brief
 *    This function is used to send a series of commands to the CERT block. For
 *    each command part pxCommands buffer, the CERT driver has to systematically
 *    write the 8 32-bit CERT input registers (DATA_IN_X), wait for the command
 *    processing completion and read the 8 32-bit CERT output registers
 *    (DATA_OUT_X) as well as the 32-bit status register (STATUS_AKL).
 *
 *    If a command fails (least significant bit of STATUS_AKL set to 1) or lasts
 *    longer than expected (timeout), TCertExchange must return to the caller
 *    without handling remaining commands, if any. The number of commands
 *    processed so far, including the command that failed, must be signaled
 *    accordingly in pxNumOfProcessedCommands. A command that timed out is not
 *    considered as processed, thus must not be counted in
 *    pxNumOfProcessedCommands. Values of DATA_OUT_X registers and STATUS_AKL
 *    register of the faulty command must be returned as well.
 *
 *  @param[in] xResourceHandle
 *    Handle to the CERT resource.
 *
 *  @param[in] xNumOfCommands
 *    Number of commands to be processed by the CERT block.
 *
 *  @param[in,out] pxCommands
 *    Buffer containing xNumOfCommands instantiations of TCertCommand structure.
 *    This structure is used to accommodate input parameters of each command as
 *    well as resulting output. The memory is allocated by the caller.
 *
 *  @param[out] pxNumOfProcessedCommands
 *    Number of commands actually processed by the CERT block. If all commands 
 *    are processed successfully, this number is equal to xNumOfCommands. If a 
 *    command fails or times out, this parameter indicates the number of 
 *    commands processed so far, including the faulty command but not the timed 
 *    out command.
 *
 *  @retval CERT_NO_ERROR
 *    All commands have been processed successfully. A command is successful if
 *    the least significant bit of STATUS_AKL is equal to 0 after the command
 *    completion.
 *
 *  @retval CERT_ERROR_BAD_HANDLE
 *    Handle provided is invalid or unknown. One typically drops in this case if
 *    this function is called while the CERT resource has not been locked.
 *
 *  @retval CERT_ERROR_TIMEOUT
 *    The timeout has expired and the CERT block is still processing a command
 *    (least significant bit of COMMAND register still to 1).
 *
 *  @retval CERT_ERROR
 *    Any other errors occurred at driver level or reported by the CERT block
 *    during the processing of a command (least significant bit of STATUS_AKL
 *    equal to 1).
