/** @page p_preface Preface
 *  <h2>Objectives</h2>
 *  This document specifies the Secure Chipset API that gives access to Nagra
 *  security features of the MPEG chipset.
 *
 *  It includes standard cryptographic functions such as symmetric block ciphers
 *  (TDES, AES), asymmetric cryptographic functions (RSA, Diffie-Hellman) as
 *  well as digest functions (SHA, HMAC). Cryptographic operations are based on
 *  cleartext keys, secret keys protected by hardware key ladders or secret keys
 *  protected by the Nagra custom hardware block (CERT IP block).
 *
 *  Cryptographic functions are intended to be interfaced with hardware
 *  accelerators to achieve better performances.
 *
 *  <hr><h2>Audience</h2>
 *  This document is intended for developers in charge of implementing the SEC
 *  API and as well as developers that intend to use the SEC API in their
 *  application.

/** @page p_sw_stack Software stack context
 *  The figure below depicts the context of the SEC component.
 *  @image html os_sw_stack.png
 *  @image rtf os_sw_stack.png
 *
 *  The SoC vendor is in charge of providing a reference implementation of the
 *  SEC API to the STB manufacturer. A reference implementation of the CERT API
 *  is also provided in case the chipset integrates the Nagra CERT IP block. 
 *  The STB manufacturer has the responsibility of the final implementation of 
 *  these API on its hardware platform. In particular, the STB manufacturer may
 *  need to modify the reference implementation in order to control and manage 
 *  hardware resource allocation conflicts.
 *
 *  It has to be noted that the support of stream encryption/decryption sessions
 *  is usually strongly related to the middleware. Thus the SoC vendor will very
 *  likely provide a basic reference implementation of this feature that will
 *  have to be completed by the STB manufacturer or middleware provider.
 *
 *  The usage of the SEC API is not restricted to CA applications. It may be used
 *  by any application that would like to take benefit from these accelerated
 *  cryptographic primitives. As a result, implementation of the SEC API must be
 *  thread safe and reentrant.
 *
 *  The corollary is that the SEC API may be used only if the operating system is
 *  up and running. Thus it cannot be used during the secure boot phase. Access
 *  to cryptographic accelerators during the system boot is achieved through the
 *  <i>Bare Security Driver</i> (BSD). Refer to the documentation of this API
 *  for further information.
 *
*/

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/** @page p_fct_table Function table
 *
 *  Functions of the SEC API are exposed to applications through a table of
 *  callback functions retrieved through a call to secGetFunctionTable().
 *
 *  The table also contains the version number of the implemented SEC API. It is
 *  strongly recommended to use the macro #SECAPI_VERSION_INT to assign the
 *  correct version number in the function table.
 *
 *  Functions that were defined before the introduction of the function table
 *  concept are kept for backward compatibility. However, they are also
 *  redefined as callback and inserted in the function table.
 *
 *  The list of functions to be implemented on the final product depends on the
 *  version of the CAS integrated.  A \c NULL pointer has to be set in the
 *  function table for each function that is not implemented.
*/

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/** @page p_thread_safety Thread safety, reentrancy and mutual exclusion
 *
 *  The SEC API may be used by several software components running in different
 *  threads or processes. Thus, implementation of all functions of the SEC API
 *  must be thread safe and reentrant to manage concurrent access from different
 *  threads or processes.
 *
 *  If functions called concurrently from different threads or processes are
 *  accessing shared resources, the SEC API implementation must guarantee the
 *  mutual exclusion and serialize access to these resources.
 *
 *  Depending on the operating system architecture, inter-process communication
 *  (IPC) methods might be required to achieve the mutual exclusion.
 *
 *  On the other hand, a function may be called concurrently from different
 *  threads or processes without sharing the same resource. For instance
 *  TSecSessionEncrypt() may be called from two processes at the same time and
 *  requires respectively an AES block cipher and TDES block cipher. This case
 *  illustrates the reentrancy requirement.
*/

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/** @page p_bignum Big numbers
 *
 *  Asymmetric cryptographic functions mainly consist in big numbers arithmetic
 *  calculations. SEC API functions use byte array buffers for passing in and
 *  out big number parameters. These buffers are always allocated by the caller
 *  and have a size that usually depends on the key size.
 *
 *  Big numbers are stored in byte array buffers in big endian format (MSBF). If
 *  the effective size of a number is smaller than the buffer size, it must be
 *  padded with leading zeros to match the buffer size.
 *
 *  The caller is also responsible to allocate buffers containing input messages
 *  to operate on as well as buffers to store output messages. Refer to \ref
 *  p_buffer for special considerations about these allocations.
*/


/** @page p_buffer Buffers allocations management
 *
 *    Hardware cryptoprocessors may require special buffers (e.g. contiguous
 *    pages in physical memory, limited address space, pages alignment, etc) to
 *    work properly. TSecAllocateBuffer() and TSecFreeBuffer() are designed to
 *    handle such buffers.
 *
 *    Although many SEC API functions parameters are defined as byte array
 *    buffers, it has been decided to force the usage of TSecAllocateBuffer() only
 *    for RAM2RAM input/output messages and digest input messages. This choice
 *    is motivated by the fact that these buffers can be relatively large. Thus
 *    allocating these buffers directly in the right format avoids memory
 *    reallocation and memory copies at the driver level.
 *
 *    For all other parameters, the client can use standard memory allocation
 *    functions or declare them on the stack or as static variables. The driver
 *    is in charge of converting these parameters to the right format if required.
 *
 *    These considerations do not apply to secEncryptData() and
 *    secDecryptData() functions, because of backward compatibility with older
 *    client applications.

/** @page p_emi Encryption Method Indicator (EMI)
 *
 *  <h2>Introduction</h2>
 *  There are many ways to encrypt data. An encryption algorithm (like AES,
 *  TDES, ...) with optionally its associated mode of operation (like ECB, CBC
 *  or CTR, ...) has, of course, to be chosen but this is often not enough to
 *  specify unequivocally an encryption method. Indeed, some less obvious
 *  information like data handling and key formats have also to be well defined
 *  if interoperability between different platforms shall be ensured. Moreover
 *  it is impossible to build a pre-defined exhaustive list of parameters
 *  qualifying explicitly each Encryption Method because the parameters needed
 *  could be specific to a given Encryption Method only.
 *
 *  Therefore, in order to deal with this complexity and to have a mean to
 *  uniquely identify the way data are encrypted/decrypted, Nagravision
 *  allocates a unique 16-bits identifier, referred to as EMI, to all referenced
 *  Encryption Methods (see [EMI]). Each Encryption Method identified by its EMI
 *  has a dedicated detailed specification. That specification might either be
 *  an international standard or a Nagravision specification.
 *
 *  <hr><h2>RAM2RAM Operations</h2>
 *  EMIs to be supported depend on their usage. For RAM2RAM operations, the SEC
 *  driver must support all standard EMIs, except MPEG TS EMIs, that  is to say
 *  all EMIs having the most significant byte equal to 0x40. Moreover, in this
 *  context the driver only needs to care about the algorithm and chaining mode.
 *  For instance if the MPEG/DASH EMI 0x4024 is provided to a RAM2RAM session,
 *  the SEC driver must only take into account the AES algorithm and CTR
 *  chaining mode and does not need to support the full MPEG/DASH stack. So from
 *  this standpoint, EMIs 0x4024 and 0x4027 are strictly identical.
 *
 *  The following table gives a summary of the cryptographic algorithms and
 *  chaining modes to be supported by RAM2RAM sessions along with their
 *  corresponding EMIs.
 *
 *  <table class="doxtable">
 *  <tr>
 *  <th>Algorithm</th><th>EMI [hex]</th></tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>AES-128-ECB</td><td>4021</td></tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>AES-128-CBC</td><td>4020, 4022, 4023, 4026</td></tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>AES-128-CTR</td><td>4024, 4027</td></tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>TDES-128-ECB</td><td>4041</td></tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>TDES-128-CBC</td><td>4040, 4043</td></tr>
 *  </table>
 *  \n
 *
 *  <hr><h2>Stream Processing Operations</h2>
 *  Stream processing operations requires all EMIs 0x00xx (MPEG TS EMIs) and all
 *  EMIs 0x40xx to be supported. Moreover, unlike RAM2RAM operations, the SEC driver
 *  must not only focus on the algorithm and chaining mode, but is also responsible
 *  for managing the streams to operate on. Indeed, the SEC client is limited to
 *  providing a key and a reference to the streams (transport session ID).
 *

/** @page p_tdes_key TDES key format
 *
 *  TDES operations use a 128-bit input key. Actually this key is broken down in
 *  two 64-bit keys K1 and K2 complying with the Keying Option 2 of FIPS PUB
 *  46-3. K1=K3 corresponds to the 8 most significant bytes of the 128-bit input
 *  key while K2 corresponds to the 8 least significant bytes as depicted in the
 *  figure below.

/**  @page p_keyladders Key ladders and crypto-engine
 *
 *  A Block Cipher (also known as Crypto-Engine) encrypts/decrypts bulk data
 *  with a symmetric key, called hereafter Content Key.
 *
 *  The content key provided to the block cipher may come from different sources
 *  and may be protected by a key ladder. Following sections describes the
 *  different means to provide this content key to the block cipher.
 *
 *  A key ladder is based on a secret root key (RK) that is never available in
 *  clear-text form outside of the chipset secure crypto-environment. In the
 *  same way, the content key path between the output of a key ladder and the
 *  input of a crypto-engine is also strongly protected to avoid exposing the
 *  content key in in clear-text form.
 *
 *  <hr>@section s_bc_clearkey Clear-text content key
 *  A crypto engine may be fed with a clear-text content key. This is achieved by
 *  calling the SEC API function TSecSetClearTextKey(). The cryptographic
 *  algorithm of the crypto engine is selected by the caller through the EMI
 *  parameter.
 *  @image html bc_cleartext_key.png
 *  @image rtf bc_cleartext_key.png
 *
 *
 *  <hr>@section s_bc_rootkey Content key protected with root key
 *  A crypto engine may be fed with a root key derived from the Nagra secret.
 *  This use case is achieved by calling SEC API functions secEncryptData() 
 *  and secDecryptData(). These functions do not have any parameter, thus the
 *  choice of the root key and cryptographic algorithm is implicit and fixed to
 *  TDES.
 *  @image html bc_root_key.png
 *  @image rtf bc_root_key.png
 *
 *  <hr>@section s_bc_0kl_prot Content key protected with 0-level key ladder
 *  A crypto engine may be fed with a content key protected by a 0-level key
 *  ladder (key ladder made of 1 key ladder element). This is achieved by
 *  calling the SEC API function TSecSet0LevelProtectedKey().
 *  @image html bc_0kl_prot_key.png
 *  @image rtf bc_0kl_prot_key.png
 *
 *  <hr>@section s_bc_1kl_prot Content key protected with 1-level key ladder
 *  A crypto engine may be fed with a content key protected by a 1-level key
 *  ladder (key ladder made of 2 key ladder elements). This is achieved by
 *  calling the SEC API function TSecSet1LevelProtectedKey().
 *  @image html bc_1kl_prot_key.png
 *  @image rtf bc_1kl_prot_key.png
 *
 *  <hr>@section s_bc_2kl_prot Content key protected with 2-level key ladder
 *  A crypto engine may be fed with a content key protected by a 2-level key
 *  ladder (key ladder made of 3 key ladder elements). This is achieved by
 *  calling the SEC API function TSecSet2LevelProtectedKey().
 *  @image html bc_2kl_prot_key.png
 *  @image rtf bc_2kl_prot_key.png
 *
 *  The cryptographic algorithm of the crypto engine is selected by the caller
 *  through the EMI parameter. This EMI has nothing to do with the cryptographic
 *  algorithm used in internal stages of a key ladder. Indeed, this latter
 *  algorithm is fixed to TDES-1 keying option 2 and cannot be changed by the
 *  caller.
 *
 *  <hr>@section s_bc_certkey Content key coming from CERT block
 *  A block cipher may be fed with a content key coming from the Nagra CERT
 *  block. This is achieved by calling the function TSecUseCertKey(). The
 *  cryptographic algorithm of the crypto engine is selected by the caller
 *  through the EMI parameter.

/** @page p_stream_overview Overview
 *
 *  The support of stream processing sessions has been introduced in the SEC API
 *  to replace former DSC API and SCR API. The main advantage of this merge is a
 *  single entry point the key management of required by the
 *  encryption/decryption of media streams.
 *
 *  A SEC stream encryption session specifies the set of hardware resources
 *  needed for locally encrypting a certain media stream. Similarly, a SEC
 *  stream decryption session specifies the set of hardware resources needed to
 *  decrypt locally a certain media stream. Media streams are identified in this
 *  API by means of \ref p_tsid "Transport Session Identifiers". The STB
 *  software is in charge of managing hardware resource allocation and the
 *  mapping of media streams to SEC stream encryption and decryption sessions. A
 *  typical application of stream encryption and decryption sessions is DVR
 *  recording and playback sessions respectively.
 *
 *  The SEC client (CA software) is in charge of providing content keys to
 *  successfully encrypt/decrypt media streams referenced by a transport session
 *  ID.
 *
 *  Content keys may be provided in clear-text form, protected by a chipset key
 *  ladder or protected by the Nagra CERT IP block. SEC stream processing
 *  sessions may also be used in a "legacy mode"; in this case, the content key

/** @page p_tsid Transport Session ID
 *
 *  Today's decoders may have various stream sources (satellite tuner, broadband
 *  connection, terrestrial tuner, external hard drive) and several destinations
 *  (TV output 1, TV output 2, hard drive, Ethernet port, etc.). A media stream
 *  flowing from a source to a destination traverses a series of processing
 *  elements such as MPEG2 demultiplexing, DVB-CSA descrambling, MPEG2 video/audio
 *  decoding, and so on. The chipset crypto-engine is one of such processing
 *  element. Figure below illustrates three different transport sessions,
 *  connecting various sources, stream processing elements and destinations.
 *  @image html tsid_overview.png
 *  @image rtf tsid_overview.png
 *
 *  A certain number of hardware resources are allocated in the decoder in order
 *  to support this processing chain for that particular media stream. We will
 *  denote the set of resources allocated to a certain media stream as a
 *  transport session or simply a pipe. Each transport session is identified
 *  uniquely by means of a so called transport session identifier (TSID).
 *
 *  Figure below illustrates an example of a live A/V stream that is being
 *  recorded on the hard drive and a live A/V stream that is decoded and
 *  presented on the TV screen.
 *
 *  @image html tsid_usecase.png
 *  @image rtf tsid_usecase.png
 *
 *  In that example, two stream decryption sessions are opened with a
 *  dedicated transport session identifier:
 *
 *  a) The first transport session is defined for descrambling the live content
 *  to be stored on the hard drive. Note that two crypto-engine elements are
 *  required in this case: one for descrambling the live content and another one
 *  for re-scrambling it with another key before storing it on the hard drive.
 *
 *  b) A second transport session is defined  for descrambling the live content
 *  to be presented on the TV screen.
 *
 *  Each crypto-engine element of a transport session requires a dedicated SEC
 *  API stream session (encryption or decryption) - see
 *  TSecOpenStreamEncryptSession() and TSecOpenStreamDecryptSession().
 *
 *  The transport session ID is the main criteria to attach a SEC stream session
 *  to a crypto-engine element. However this criteria is not always sufficient.
 *  In the use case above, two SEC sessions are opened with the transport
 *  session ID 1. In this case, the SEC driver is in charge of associating the
 *  SEC stream decryption session to the first crypto-engine element and the SEC
 *  stream encryption session to the second crypto-engine element.
 *
 *  Depending on the complexity of the use case to achieve, the cryptographic
 *  algorithm (identified by an EMI) may be another criteria, in addition to the
 *  transport session ID, to link the right SEC session to the right
 *  crypto-engine element.

 *  - SCS automatically decrypts the FPK located in the flash SCS_Params_Area.

 *  - The resulting cleartext FPK is copied in RAM and authenticated.
 *  - SCS uses this authenticated FPK to decrypt the boot code, which is the

 *  @brief
 *    This function asks the RAM2RAM crypto-engine to TDES decrypt a block of
 *    data stored in RAM with the RAM2RAM root key and write the result back in
 *    RAM. The choice of the encryption key and cryptographic algorithm is
 *    implicit.
 *
 *    If the caller provides the same input and output buffer (pxInput=pxOutput),
 *    the function must perform an in-place encryption.
 *
*  @param[out] pxOutput
 *    Buffer allocated by the caller where to write the decrypted result
 *
 *  @param[in] pxInput
 *    Buffer containing the block of data to be decrypted.
 *
 *  @param[in] xDataSize
 *    Length in bytes of input and output data blocks to operate on. It shall
 *    be a multiple of 8.
 *
 *  @retval  SEC_NO_ERROR
 *    The operation was completed successfully.
 *
 *  @retval  SEC_ERROR
 *    Errors occurred and the operation could not be completed successfully.
 *    Also returned if xDataSize is not a multiple of 8 (TDES block cipher size).
 *
 *  @retval  SEC_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
 *    The function is not implemented.
 *
 *  @note
 *    Unlike TSecSessionDecrypt(), this function does not require high
 *    throughput and must support standard input/output buffers to remain
 *    compatible with older client applications. Thus it should not be coupled
 *    with a DMA that requires special buffers. In other words, this function
 *    must work properly even if the caller did not allocate buffers with
 *    TSecAllocateBuffer().

 *
 *    This function also checks the usage rules related to the key. Finally, it

 *
 *    EMIs to be supported depend on the type of session. RAM2RAM sessions cover
