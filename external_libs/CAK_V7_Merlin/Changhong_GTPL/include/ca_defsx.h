/**
 *  @brief
 *    Transport session identifier.
 *
 *    An advanced device may manage more than one input stream. For example,
 *    a box may have a stream feed coming from a hard drive (DVR box) or a
 *    second tuner (for the PIP feature). <BR>
 *    In these cases, it is necessary to identify each of these streams
 *    individually. We will call these streams transport session. They are
 *    identified with a transport session identifier provided by the decoder
 *    manufacturer.<BR>
 *    The transport session identifier comes from this interface and is passed
 *    as is to the demultiplexer and descrambler drivers.<BR>
 *    ECMs as well as EMMs can be in any transport session
 *
