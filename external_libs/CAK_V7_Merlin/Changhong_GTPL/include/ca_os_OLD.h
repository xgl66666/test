 *    This file describes the OS functions to be implemented in order to
 *    integrate the NagraVision CA applications. All functions of this API may
 *    be concurrently called from different task contexts (multi-tasking OS).
 *    They must therefore be re-entrant. On the other hand, osTaskIdentify() and
 *    osTimerCreate() are the only functions of this API that cannot be called
 *    from any task context, but only in contexts created by osTaskCreate().

/**
 *  @brief
 *    The timer mechanism allows a task to be notified after a real time delay.
 *    The notification is done by sending events to the task that created the

 *
 *    A timer can run in two modes a) one-shot b) continuous. In the first
 *    case, events are sent only once when the timer expires. In the second
 *    case, the timer is automatically re-started for a new occurrence so that
 *    events are sent periodically.
 *
 *    This function creates a timer, but do not start it. The caller provides
 *    the set of events to be sent at expiration as well as the running mode
 *    (one-shot or continuous). The timeout is not provided at the timer
 *    creation. It is provided when the timer is started (see \c osTimerStart).
