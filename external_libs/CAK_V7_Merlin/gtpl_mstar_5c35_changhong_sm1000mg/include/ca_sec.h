    Unprotect the given keystore through operations based on the TEE SoC hardware
    secrets.
    
  @details
    This function has two different operation modes (1-step and 2-step modes) that 
    depend on the keystore protection function implementation.
    
    <b>1-step mode</b>: ::TSecUnprotectKeystore expects a protected keystore as input parameter 
    After the call completes successfully, pxKeystore contains the unprotected keystore. 
    So it is assumed that the operation is done in-place and that the unprotected 
    keystore is smaller or equal to the protected keystore.
    
    <b>2-step mode</b>: ::TSecUnprotectKeystore does not expect any protected keystore
    as input parameter. In order for the caller to provide a pxKeystore
    buffer of the right size, TSecUnprotectKeystore is called a first time with
    a @c NULL pxKeystore parameter and returns successfully with pxOutputSize set
    to the right value. Then the caller allocates a buffer of a suitable size and 
    call TSecUnprotectKeystore a second time to actually get the unprotected keystore.
  
  @param[inout]  pxKeystore
    1-step mode: Buffer containing the keystore to be unprotected. If the 
    operation completes successfully, the buffer contain the unprotected keystore.@n
    2-step mode: Buffer where to copy the unprotected keystore.
  
  @param[in]  xInputSize
    1-step mode: Size in bytes of the keystore to be unprotected.@n
    2-step mode: This parameter is set to 0 on the first call. It is set to the
    output buffer size on the second call.
  
  @param[out]  pxOutputSize
    Size in bytes of the unprotected keystore.
  
  @retval  SEC_NO_ERROR
    The operation was completed successfully.
  
  @retval  SEC_ERROR
    Errors occurred and the operation could not be completed successfully.
    
  @note
    The protection function is not part of this API. Its definition is left to
