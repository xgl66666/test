/**
 *  @brief
 *    This function attempts to make a connection with a remote computer. It is 
 *    asynchronous and must not block the calling task. This caters for systems 
 *    where the connection is only available at discrete times, for instance 
 *    when the set-top box connects through a PC-controlled modem that can only 
 *    be used when the user of the PC has established a connection to the 
 *    Internet.
 *    
 *    To simplify the transition from the older synchronous \c rphConnect(), it 
 *    is admitted that \c rphConnect() attempts to establish the connection 
 *    synchronously and calls the callback from within the function's body, 
 *    provided that the caller is not delayed for more than 30 seconds. New 
 *    implementations must perform the connection asynchronously, i.e. it must 
 *    return immediately and attempt to connect in background. As soon as the 
 *    connection is established, data might be received, even if \c rphReceive() 
 *    has not been called yet. These must not be lost and at least \c 
 *    xInternalBufferSize bytes must be stored in an internal FIFO buffer. These 
 *    will be returned to the forthcoming call to \c rphReceive(). Once this 
 *    buffer is filled, it is acceptable that some bytes get lost.
