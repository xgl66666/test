/**
 *  @brief
 *    This function asks the RAM2RAM Crypto Engine to encrypt a block of data
 *    stored in RAM and write the result back in RAM.
 *
 *    The length of the input data block must be a multiple of 8 bytes. 
 *    Otherwise, the function shall return SEC_ERROR.
 *
 *    The contents of the buffers pointed at by pxDst and pxSrc are both a 
 *    sequence of 8-byte blocks in memory. Each 8-byte block shall be encoded 
 *    in MSBF (Most-Significant Byte First, First meaning lowest address). 
 *    Specifically, given a 64 bit data block as represented in FIPS PUB 46-3, 
 *    the bit number 1 of the block shall be stored as the most-significant bit 
 *    of the first byte in memory (lowest address) and bit number 64 of the 
 *    block shall be stored as the least-significant bit of the last byte in 
 *    memory (highest address).
 *  
 *    Beware that underlying hardware may use a byte ordering other than what 
 *    is specified in this document. For example, some DMA-based engines may 
 *    read and write data in a little-endian way, whereas this API requires 
 *    big-endian representation. Similar issues may appear with non-DMA 
 *    hardware engines. If the underlying hardware is not accessed directly but
 *    through a software library provided by the chip vendor, similar issues 
 *    may arise with the chip vendor's API.
 *
 *    In all such cases, the DAL implementation shall change the byte ordering 
 *    of input data so it is interpreted correctly by the underlying hardware; 
 *    it shall also change the byte ordering of output data so it is presented 
 *    in the right order to the API client.
 *
 *  @pre
 *    None.
 *
 *  @post
 *    None.
 *
 *  @param[out] pxDst
 *    Pointer to the location in RAM where the encrypted result has to be 
 *    written. The client software is responsible for allocating memory.

 *    Block of data in RAM that has to be encrypted.
